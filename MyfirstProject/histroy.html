        <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2><br>
        <br>
        <span class="historyheadline">The Pre-Islamic Period:</span> Archaeological evidence indicates that urban civilization began in the region occupied by modern Afghanistan between 3000 and 2000 B.C. The first historical documents date
        from the early part of the Iranian Achaemenian Dynasty, which controlled the region
        from 550 B.C. until 331 B.C. Between 330 and 327 B.C., Alexander the Great defeated
        the Achaemenian emperor Darius III and subdued local resistance in the territory that is
        now Afghanistan. Alexander’s successors, the Seleucids, continued to infuse the region
        with Greek cultural influence. Shortly thereafter, the Mauryan Empire of India gained
        control of southern Afghanistan, bringing with it Buddhism. In the mid-third century
        B.C., nomadic Kushans established an empire that became a cultural and commercial
        center. From the end of the Kushan Empire in the third century A.D. until the seventh
        century, the region was fragmented and under the general protection of the Iranian
        Sassanian Empire.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="historyheadline">The Islamic and Mongol Conquests:</span> After defeating the Sassanians at the Battle of Qadisiya in 637, Arab Muslims began a 100-year process of conquering the Afghan tribes and introducing Islam. By the tenth
        century, the rule of the Arab Abbasid Dynasty and its successor in Central Asia, the
        Samanid dynasty, had crumbled. The Ghaznavid Dynasty, an offshoot of the Samanids,
        then became the first great Islamic dynasty to rule in Afghanistan. In 1220 all of Central
        Asia fell to the forces of Genghis Khan. Afghanistan remained fragmented until
        the 1380s, when Timur consolidated and expanded the existing Mongol Empire. Timur’s
        descendants ruled Afghanistan until the early sixteenth century.<br>

        <span class="historyheadline">The Pashtun Rulers:</span> In 1504 the region fell under a new empire, the Mughals of northern India, who for the next two centuries contested Afghan territory with the Iranian Safavi Dynasty. With the
        death of the great Safavi leader Nadir Shah in 1747, indigenous Pashtuns, who became
        known as the Durrani, began a period of at least nominal rule in Afghanistan that lasted
        until 1978. The first Durrani ruler, <strong>Ahmad Shah</strong>, known as the founder of the Afghan
        nation, united the Pashtun tribes and by 1760 built an empire extending to Delhi and the
        Arabian Sea. The empire fragmented after Ahmad Shah’s death in 1772, but in 1826 <strong>Dost
        Mohammad</strong>, the leader of the Pashtun Muhammadzai tribe, restored order.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="historyheadline">The Great Game:</span> Dost Mohammad ruled at the beginning of the Great Game, a century-long contest for domination of Central Asia and Afghanistan between Russia, which was expanding to the
        south, and Britain, which was intent on protecting India. During this period, Afghan
        rulers were able to maintain virtual independence, although some compromises were
        necessary. In the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42), the British deposed Dost
        Mohammad, but they abandoned their Afghan garrisons in 1842. In the following
        decades, Russian forces approached the northern border of Afghanistan. In 1878 the
        British invaded and held most of Afghanistan in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. <br>

          </figure>
        </div>
        In 1880 <strong>Abdur Rahman</strong>, a Durrani, began a 21-year reign that saw the balancing of British and
        Russian interests, the consolidation of the Afghan tribes, and the reorganization of civil
        administration into what is considered the modern Afghan state. During this period, the
        British secured the Durand Line (1893), dividing Afghanistan from British colonial
        territory to the southeast and sowing the seeds of future tensions over the division of the
        Pashtun tribes. Abdur Rahman’s son Habibullah (ruled 1901–19) continued his father’s
        administrative reforms and maintained Afghanistan’s neutrality in World War I.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="historyheadline">Full Independence and Soviet Occupation:</span>
        In 1919 Afghanistan signed the Treaty of Rawalpindi, which ended the Third Anglo-
        Afghan War and marks Afghanistan’s official date of independence. In the interwar
        period, Afghanistan again was a balancing point between two world powers; Habibullah’s
        son Amanullah (ruled 1919–29) skillfully manipulated the new British-Soviet rivalry and
        established relations with major countries. Amanullah introduced his country’s first
        constitution in 1923. However, resistance to his domestic reform program forced his
        abdication in 1929. In 1933 Amanullah’s nephew <strong>Mohammad Zahir Shah</strong>, the last king of
        Afghanistan, began a 40-year reign.<br>
        <br>After World War II, in which Afghanistan remained neutral, the long-standing division of
        the Pashtun tribes caused tension with the neighboring state of Pakistan, founded on the
        other side of the Durand Line in 1948. In response, Afghanistan shifted its foreign policy
        toward the Soviet Union. The prime minister ship of the king’s cousin Mohammad Daoud
        (1953–63) was cautiously reformist, modernizing and centralizing the government while
        strengthening ties with the Soviet Union. However, in 1963 Zahir Shah dismissed Daoud
        because his anti-Pakistani policy had damaged Afghanistan’s economy.<br>
        <br>
        <div class="img">

          </figure>
        </div>
        A new constitution, ratified in 1964, liberalized somewhat the constitutional monarchy.
        However, in the ensuing decade economic and political conditions worsened. In 1973
        Daoud overthrew the king and established a republic. When economic conditions did not
        improve and Daoud lost most of his political support, communist factions overthrew him
        in 1978. In 1979 the threat of tribal insurgency against the communist government
        triggered an invasion by 80,000 Soviet troops, who then endured a very effective decade-
        long guerrilla war. Between 1979 and 1989, two Soviet-sponsored regimes failed to
        defeat the loose federation of mujahideen guerrillas [who were supported by the US, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, note from the editor] that opposed the occupation. In 1988 the Soviet Union agreed to create a neutral Afghan state, and the last Soviet troops left
        Afghanistan in 1989. The agreement ended a war that killed thousands, devastated
        industry and agriculture, and created 5 to 6 million refugees.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="historyheadline">Civil War and the Taliban:</span> The 1988 agreement did not settle differences between the government and the
        mujahideen, and in 1992 Afghanistan descended into a civil war that further ravaged the
        economy. Among the leaders of the warring factions were Ahmad Shah Massoud, an
        ethnic Tajik; Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a Pashtun; and Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek.
        Despite several temporary alliances, struggles among the armed groups continued until
        one Islamic fundamentalist group, the Taliban, gained control of most of the country in
        1996. The Taliban used an extremist interpretation of Islam to assert repressive control of
        society. The economy remained in ruins, and most government services ceased.<br>
        <br>
        The Taliban granted the Arab terrorist organization al Qaeda the right to use Afghanistan
        as a base. As al Qaeda committed a series of international terrorist acts culminating in
        attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, the Taliban rejected international
        pressure to surrender al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. When the United States and
        allies attacked Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, the Taliban government collapsed, but
        Taliban and al Qaeda leaders escaped. A United States–led International Security
        Assistance Force began an occupation that is still in place in 2008.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="historyheadline">Rebuilding the Country:</span> In December 2001, Afghan leaders in exile signed the Bonn Agreement, forming an interim government, the Afghan Interim Administration, under the leadership of the
        Pashtun moderate <strong>Hamid Karzai</strong>. In 2002 Karzai was selected president of the
        Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan, whose ruling council included disparate leaders
        of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. A new constitution, written by a specially
        convened Loya Jirga, or constituent assembly of regional leaders, was ratified in early
        2004. In October 2004, an overwhelming popular vote elected Karzai president of the
        Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. However, regional warlords and large areas of
        Afghanistan remained beyond the control of the Karzai government. Despite substantial
        international aid, the Afghan government, which included representatives from many
        factions, was unable to address numerous social and economic problems. The
        parliamentary elections of September 2005 gave regional warlords substantial power in
        both houses of the National Assembly, further jeopardizing Karzai’s ability to unite the
        country. The Bonn Agreement lapsed after the 2005 elections. <br>

        The agreement’s successor, the Afghanistan Compact, went into effect in January 2006 to set goals for
        international assistance in economic development, security, protection of human rights,
        and the fight against corruption and drug trafficking through 2010.<br>

        In the meantime, the resurgent Taliban intensified terrorist activities in areas beyond
        government control, particularly the southeastern provinces. In mid-2006, North Atlantic
        Treaty Organization (NATO) forces turned back a Taliban offensive aimed at Kandahar.
        However, beginning in 2007 the Taliban utilized safe havens in adjacent Pakistan to
        gradually restore and expand its control in Afghanistan. In early 2008, it controlled an
        estimated 10 percent of the country while the government controlled only an estimated 30
        percent. Local tribes controlled the remaining territory. Despite U.S.-aided efforts to
        reduce cultivation of poppies for narcotics production, in 2007 and 2008 that crop
        accounted for an increasing percentage of Afghanistan’s economy and was a major
        support of the Taliban. In mid-2008, a new International Conference in Support of
        Afghanistan reaffirmed international commitments to the country’s economic and
        political stability but demanded improved coordination of aid and reduced corruption.
        Meanwhile, widespread economic hardship increasingly weakened the Karzai
        government’s support among the population.<br>
